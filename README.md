- 👋 Hi, I’m @byhowe
- I love Rust, hate Haskell, don't know how I feel about Python
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Rust, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, AI and many more things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis tools in Python

I am currently working on a cryptography library that I started writing in Rust
over 2 years ago. I left it underfed for quite a long time and I am so glad I
finally got back around to it.

I use arch btw.
