- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @byhowe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux, Rust, Statistics, AI and many more things
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis tools in Python

I am currently working on a cryptography library that I started writing in Rust
over 2 years ago. I left it underfed for quite a long time and I am so glad I
finally got back around to it.

I use arch, btw you can get my config files
[here](https://github.com/byhowe/dotfiles).
